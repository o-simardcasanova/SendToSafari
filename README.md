Send to Safari allows you to open all Chrome tabs in Safari. You just have to click on the app logo, all the tabs will be transfered.

Send to Safari basically wraps [this AppleScript gist](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/d7df1a5ff5d269b9884a9d22461af613) by [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish) in an Automator app. I just added a basic logo (as you'll see I'm *not* a designer). Considering it's an AppleScript script it should be broadly compatible, but I only tested it on my own macOS 10.12.3. **Use Send to Safari at your own risks.**

The easiest way to use Send to Safari is probably to have it on your Dock, and open it when needed. You can also invoke it through Spotlight or by any mean you want.
